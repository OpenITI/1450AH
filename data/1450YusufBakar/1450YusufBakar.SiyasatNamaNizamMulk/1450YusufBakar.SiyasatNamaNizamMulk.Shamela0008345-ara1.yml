90#VERS#COMMENT##: PDF is a (third) reprint of the version the digital
    text is based on. Pagination differs (because of inclusion of two extra
    introductions) but is fairly easy to follow nonetheless. Text is of good
    quality. Authorship is however problematic as this is a modern
    translation from Persian. A URI change suggestion has been raised to
    change it to the translator's name.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
