90#VERS#COMMENT##: Appears in good order compared to printed edition. Qa'ida's
    are introduced formulaically with:  al-qa'ida' + ordinal number: e.g., al-thani
    + phrase in square brackets, e.g., [xxx]. New line: phrase: 'Awalan: lafz wurud
    al-qa'ida'. New line: the canon itself, sometimes in speech marks, sometimes
    not. Indexes are included w/ full lists of qa'idas (not every volume, but groups
    thereof covering multiple volumes and final volume index is missing).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
