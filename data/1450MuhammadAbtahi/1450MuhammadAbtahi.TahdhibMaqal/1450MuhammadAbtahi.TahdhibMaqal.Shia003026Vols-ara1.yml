90#VERS#COMMENT##: This book is a commentary written by the contemporary author, Abtahi, on Najashi’s Kitab al-Rijal. The point is that the whole commentary is in the footnotes. So, the body text is Kitab al-Rijal by Najashi and Abtahi’s commentary is in the footnotes. We should not delete the footnotes in this text, since the footnote is actually the main text here. 2- I tagged all the names in the body text, i.e. Najashi’s text, manually. It is not possible to tag the text in the footnotes at the time being since it is in a bad condition and to tag it, first it needs to be separated. 2- Numbers 198-9 are lost in both the PDF and the digital version. It must be a problem in the printed version.
