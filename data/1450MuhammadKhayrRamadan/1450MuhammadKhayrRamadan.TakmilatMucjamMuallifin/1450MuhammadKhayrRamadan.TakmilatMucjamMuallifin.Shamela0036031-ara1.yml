90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Each page number is repeated three times. This is
    because the PDF is written in three columns and the page numbers are
    repeated at the end of each column. 2- Many of the name entries (### $)
    have subsetions. Most of these subsections are to introduce the writings
    of the person under discussion. These subsections are not bold in the
    PDF, but they were pre-tagged. So, I kept the tags because they are
    useful. I just changed the automatic tags to “#~:section”:.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
